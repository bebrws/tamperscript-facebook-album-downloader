# Facebook Album Downloader TamperMonkey Script

Recently I wanted to make sure I had a backup of ALL my old photos I had stored on Facebook.

The only issue was that I had lost access to my Facebook account. Forgot my old account password and the recovery options were not working for some reason.

So I wrote this TamperMonkey script which works as of June 5th, 2021 to allow anyone to download ANY full album.

You just load the Album, scroll to the bottom of the page so all images are loaded. Then scroll back up to the top and a button in the top will appear saying to click it to start downloading.

Then about an image a second, the images will start to download!

I wrote this VERY quickly and without much care.

I think out of about a thousand photos I downloaded I might have missed 3?? possibly?

So it works pretty great for a sunday morning quick fix!

Hope this is helpful!
